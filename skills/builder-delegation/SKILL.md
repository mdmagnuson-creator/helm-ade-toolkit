# Builder Sub-Agent Delegation

> Load this skill when: delegating tasks to sub-agents, building context blocks, or using semantic search for pre-delegation context.

---

## Context Block Format

When delegating to sub-agents, **always pass a context block** following the Context Protocol.

Generate a `<context>` block at the start of every sub-agent prompt:

```yaml
<context>
version: 1
project:
  path: {absolute path to project}
  stack: {stack from project.json}
  commands:
    dev: {commands.dev}
    test: {commands.test}
    build: {commands.build}
    lint: {commands.lint}
git:
  defaultBranch: {git.defaultBranch}
  pushTo: {git.agentWorkflow.pushTo or defaultBranch}
  createPrTo: {git.agentWorkflow.createPrTo or defaultBranch}
  requiresHumanApproval: {git.agentWorkflow.requiresHumanApproval or []}
  autoCommit: {git.autoCommit}
conventions:
  summary: |
    {2-5 sentence summary of key conventions relevant to the task}
  fullPath: {path}/docs/CONVENTIONS.md
currentWork:
  prd: {current PRD name, if in PRD mode}
  story: {current story, if applicable}
  branch: {current branch}
</context>
```

**Git context is required** — sub-agents need this to validate their git operations.

---

## Context Summary Guidelines

When generating `conventions.summary`:
- **Keep it concise** — 50-100 tokens, max 200
- **Make it relevant** — Include conventions that apply to the current task
- **Include key patterns** — Language, framework, component library, error handling
- **Omit details** — Sub-agents can read `fullPath` if they need more

## Example Delegation

```markdown
<context>
version: 1
project:
  path: /Users/dev/code/project
  stack: nextjs-prisma
  commands:
    test: npm test
    lint: npm run lint
conventions:
  summary: |
    TypeScript strict. Tailwind + shadcn/ui. App Router.
    Server components by default. Prisma ORM. Zod validation.
  fullPath: /Users/dev/code/project/docs/CONVENTIONS.md
currentWork:
  prd: print-templates
  story: US-003 Add print preview modal
  branch: feature/print-templates
</context>

Implement US-003: Add print preview modal

Requirements:
- Show modal with template rendered at actual size
- Use existing Modal component from components/ui/modal.tsx
```

## Canonical Content for Documentation Tasks

> ⚠️ **MANDATORY for documentation/reproduction tasks**
>
> When delegating tasks that require faithful reproduction of toolkit-internal structures
> (field names, config schemas, multi-step flows, table columns), **embed the canonical
> content directly in the context block**. Do NOT rely on Developer reading referenced
> source files — it will fabricate plausible-but-wrong field names instead.

### When This Applies

| Task type | Example | Risk |
|-----------|---------|------|
| Documenting config schemas | "Document the auth headless CLI fields" | Developer invents field names |
| Reproducing multi-step flows | "Show the 4-step verification pipeline" | Developer restructures the flow |
| Updating examples with real field names | "Expand the project.json example" | Developer fabricates config shape |
| Syncing content across repos | "Match builder.md lines 1135-1178" | Developer paraphrases instead of copying |

### Required: Inline Canonical Source

When delegating documentation tasks, **read the source content yourself** and embed it in the context block using the `canonicalSource` field:

```yaml
<context>
version: 1
project:
  path: /Users/dev/code/website
  stack: nextjs
conventions:
  summary: |
    TypeScript strict. Tailwind + shadcn/ui. App Router.
  fullPath: /Users/dev/code/website/docs/CONVENTIONS.md
canonicalSource:
  description: "Exact content to reproduce — do not paraphrase or infer"
  sources:
    - file: agents/builder.md
      lines: "1135-1178"
      content: |
        ### Step 1: Check postChangeWorkflow override
        If project.json → postChangeWorkflow exists, use it directly.
        
        ### Step 2: Auto-infer from apps[]
        | App Type | Framework | webContent | Pipeline |
        |----------|-----------|------------|----------|
        | web      | next      | true       | HMR      |
        | desktop  | electron  | true       | rebuild  |
        ...
        
        ### Post-Change Actions (after commit)
        project.json → postChangeActions[] defines downstream propagation
        (support articles, AI tools, marketing pages, pending updates).
        See test-flow → Section 5.5 for execution details.
    - file: skills/auth-headless/SKILL.md
      lines: "331-359"
      content: |
        headless:
          enabled: true
          method: cli
          command: "npx my-cli auth login"
          responseFormat: json
          tokenPath: "$.access_token"
          refreshTokenPath: "$.refresh_token"
          sessionStorage: cookie
</context>

Reproduce the verification pipeline documentation using the canonical source above.
Field names, column headers, and flow structure MUST match exactly.
```

### Why Inline Content is Required

Developer has demonstrated a consistent **"Plausible Fabrication"** pattern:
- When told "read builder.md lines 1135-1178", it generates what it *thinks* should be there
- Fabricated content is structurally valid (passes typecheck/lint/build)
- A reviewer unfamiliar with the source wouldn't notice the wrong field names
- This pattern is invisible to automated checks

By embedding the canonical content directly, Developer has the exact text in its context window and doesn't need to read external files to reproduce it faithfully.

### Checklist Before Documentation Delegation

```
□ Identified all source files referenced in the task
□ Read each source file and extracted the relevant sections
□ Embedded extracted content in canonicalSource block
□ Included exact field names, column headers, and structure
□ Added instruction: "Field names and structure MUST match canonicalSource exactly"
```

## Primary Sub-Agents

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| @developer | All code changes |
| @tester | Test generation and orchestration |
| @ui-tester-playwright | E2E test writing |
| @critic | Code review |
| @quality-critic | Visual/a11y/performance checks |

## Analysis Gate Pre-Delegation Check (Compaction-Resilient)

> ⛔ **MANDATORY CHECK BEFORE EVERY @developer DELEGATION**
>
> This check survives context compaction because it reads from the state file, not from conversation memory.

**Before delegating to @developer, ALWAYS run this check:**

```bash
# Read analysis gate status from session.json
ANALYSIS_COMPLETED=$(jq -r '.currentAction.analysisCompleted // false' docs/sessions/current/session.json 2>/dev/null)
echo "Analysis gate check: analysisCompleted=$ANALYSIS_COMPLETED"
```

**Decision tree:**

| `analysisCompleted` | Action |
|---------------------|--------|
| `true` | ✅ Proceed with delegation |
| `false` or missing | ⛔ STOP — must show ANALYSIS COMPLETE dashboard and get [G] first |
| File doesn't exist | ⛔ STOP — initialize session, then show analysis dashboard |

**If check fails:**

1. Do NOT proceed with delegation
2. Output: `"⛔ Analysis gate not passed. Must show ANALYSIS COMPLETE dashboard and receive [G] before delegating."`
3. Run Phase 0 from `adhoc-workflow` skill
4. After receiving [G], update state: `currentAction.analysisCompleted: true` in `session.json`
5. Re-run the check (should now pass)

**Logging requirement:**

Always log the check result before delegation:
```
Analysis gate check: analysisCompleted=true ✓
Delegating to @developer...
```

This ensures the gate is enforced even after context compaction when behavioral guardrails may be summarized away.

## Semantic Search Context (US-017)

When vectorization is enabled (`project.json` → `vectorization.enabled: true`), use the `semantic_search` MCP tool to gather context BEFORE delegating to sub-agents.

### When to Use Semantic Search

| Scenario | Query | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Before implementing a feature | `"how does [feature] work"` | Understand existing patterns |
| Before modifying a file | `"what calls [function/component]"` | Understand dependencies |
| Before adding tests | `"tests for [module]"` | Find test patterns |
| Understanding data flow | `"how does [data] flow through the system"` | See call graph |
| Git history context | `"why was [file/function] changed"` | Understand intent |

### Query Patterns

```typescript
// Semantic search for context
semantic_search({ query: "how does authentication work", topK: 5 })

// Call graph query (who calls this?)
semantic_search({ query: "functions that call [functionName]", topK: 10 })

// Test mapping query (which tests cover this?)
semantic_search({ query: "tests for [moduleName]", topK: 5 })

// Git history query (why was this written?)
semantic_search({ query: "changes to [filename] and why", topK: 5 })
```

### Pre-Delegation Checklist

When vectorization is enabled, BEFORE delegating to `@developer`:

1. **Check if index exists:** `.vectorindex/metadata.json`
2. **Run semantic search** for the feature/area being modified
3. **Include relevant results** in the context block:

```yaml
<context>
version: 1
project:
  path: {path}
  stack: nextjs-prisma
semanticContext:
  query: "how does user authentication work"
  results:
    - file: src/lib/auth.ts
      summary: "Auth helper using NextAuth.js with credentials provider"
    - file: src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
      summary: "NextAuth route handler with JWT session"
  callGraph:
    - "login() is called by LoginForm, AuthProvider"
  testCoverage:
    - src/lib/auth.test.ts covers login(), logout(), getSession()
conventions:
  summary: |
    TypeScript strict. Tailwind + shadcn/ui. App Router.
</context>
```

### Graceful Fallback

- If vectorization not enabled: skip semantic search, use grep/glob as normal
- If index missing: suggest rebuild, then continue without
- If search returns no results: proceed with grep fallback
- Never block workflow on semantic search
